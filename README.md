## Project Description

This is an application similar like Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the `express-session` npm package for authentication.
